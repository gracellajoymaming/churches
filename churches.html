                     of efforts by the Filipino Catholic community to gain approval for the establishment of the Oratory and to raise the 
                     necessary funds for the construction. The church has become a favourite destination of tourists in the province.

                <h3>Santa Cruz, Boac, Marinduque </h3>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1857, the cornerstone was laid for a wooden
                     church to replace the mission church. It served the parish until 1898, when it was torn down. In 1862, the Daughters 
                     of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul opened Holy Cross School, a day school as well as a boarding school, the first 
                     educational institution in the parish. In 1889, the construction of the present brick gothic church, under Rev. Hugh
                      McNamee, marks the end of the transition from Mission Santa Cruz to Holy Cross Parish. On September 25, 1891; the 
                      citizens of Santa Cruz erected a granite archway in front of the church to commemorate the founding of Mission Santa
                       Cruz. New buildings graced the parish from the 1920s through the 1960s, including the high school and rectory. From 
                       1982 to 1984, the interior of the church was renovated in preparation for the 1989 centennial. In 1989 the church was 
                       formally consecrated. During the ten years after the earthquake, the church was repaired and retrofitted, along with
                        the convent and the Mission Chapel. A new parish hall and gym were completed in 1999, and a Historic Garden was begun 
                        over the old Mission burial grounds in tribute to our Native American brothers and sisters.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People believed that the Lady saved them from the

                      blessed in 1899. The priests of the parish, and the Saturnino Trinidad helped Capt. H.H. Bandholtz of the U.S.A. in the 
                      surrender of Col. Maximo Abad with 300 others in war, according to the National Historical Commmission (NHC) marker dated 
                      1972.Boac Cathedral  which is the oldest church in the island built in 1656. It is situated on top of a hill in a place 
                      they call Mataas na Bayan. Before you can reach the cathedral you have to make a steep climb first towards it. But the 
                      steep climb is worth the effort. At the top of the hill is the cathedral’s compound which includes the church itself.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Records show that it was built sometime in 1609.
                     The church itself is magnificent. The church interior was wonderful. The ceiling had intricate fan carvings while the 
                     altar had coves which housed different saints. Beneath the church were the catacombs but we no longer explored it. 
                     What are so astonishing with this church are the decorations on the beams of the church.  Thousands of polished 
                     coconut shells were made into tiles and carefully placed on the every beams of the church.  Beneath the church were 
                     the catacombs but it was off limits at that time. To get to it, from the National Highway, climbing up to a steep road, 
                     then a series of stairs is necessary. Once reached the top, the view was rewarding. Glimpse of the Gasan beaches and 
                     the Tres Reyes Islands while a cool breeze relieved us of the heat from climbing up the steep staircase.

                      that purpose. Only you cannot see the faces of the sisters inside.
